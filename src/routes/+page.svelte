        nice to see you here! i mean i'm not 100% sure *why* you're here, as this page isn't used for anything, but anyway...

        eventually i'll get around to making this button random, so it picks a random video from a list of great ones, but for now you're stuck with communist monopoly (it's still an amazing video though, go watch it)
